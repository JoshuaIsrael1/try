    While the Website is an honest attempt to provide access to the best possible medical information to the Users, the
    Medical Experts will not be examining You physically. The Medical Experts may not have access to all or some of Your
    medical history that might be critical to consult You. The Medical Experts will not have the benefit of information
    that would be obtained by examining You in person, observing Your physical condition and by going through Your
    medical records. This means that the Services provided is different from the diagnostic and treatment services
    typically decided by a physician. Therefore, the Medical Experts may not be aware of facts or information that would
    affect his or her opinion of Your diagnosis. To reduce the risk of this limitation, Bocxy strongly encourages You to
    be in touch with an on-ground physician and share the Bocxy’s opinion with him/her.
    By requesting a medical opinion through the Website, You acknowledge and agree that:
    the advice/information/opinion on diagnosis You may receive could be limited and provisional;

    doctor-patient relationship;
    in case of a second opinion where there is a difference of opinion among Our Medical Experts and Your physician, You
    would bear the responsibility to decide on online or offline consultation, or procedure, and/or treatment;
    the Medical Expert is reliant on information provided by You and hence any information demonstrated to have been
    falsified, misleading or incomplete will immediately render the opinion and all details therein null and void;
    in some cases, the Medical Expert may determine that the transmitted information is of inadequate quality and may
    ask for more information, without which he/she may refuse to answer the query;
    in rare cases, the Medical Experts may feel that the query may not be answerable without physically examining the
    patient/ Users and the Consultation may be refused forthwith;
    in very rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information;
    and
    delays in medical evaluation and answers could occur due to deficiencies or failures of the service as per those
    mentioned in these Terms of Service.
